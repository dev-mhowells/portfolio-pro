      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        English Deck is as a minimum viable product for an online-learning
        platform built with React. The goal was to create highly interactive
        articles for English learners which included flashcards, quizzes,
        writing practice, and the ability to read submissions from other
        learners. What started with an idea for a single page layout which
        included all of these elements, grew into site based around these
        articles with its own custom built content management system.

      <div class="screenshot-box-col">
        <img
          src="../images/article/englishdeckhome.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot img-in-col"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/englishdeckhome2.JPG"
          class="small-cap screenshot img-in-col"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        It made sense to create the app with React because I wanted the
        interactive elements of the site to be reusable and as modular as
        possible. This was not only because some of these elements are used
        multiple times within the same page, but also to allow me to easily
        build on the project by creating different page layouts and weaving in
        new interactive components should I wish to do so in the future. Using
        Firebase was also an obvious choice as it allows for rapid development
        in terms of database, storage, authentication and deployment.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cap1.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot wide-cap"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/mobile/cap2mob.jpg"
          class="small-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Challenges and Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        I had built the article itself a little while ago and there was some
        challenge involved with integrating its various components with the new
        database structure I had decided on while building the CMS. There was
        also some challenge associated with standardising the design of the app
        between the landing page and article elements. This is something which
        is still a work in progress. Coming back to CSS I had had previously
        written certainly brought home the importance of naming classes
        properly.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cap4.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot wide-cap"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/mobile/cap4mob.jpg"
          class="small-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        I also had to think about how to organise the database when it came to
        storing user comments. As Firebase is optimised for collections which
        can hold a large number of smaller documents, I decided on a structure
        whereby individual articles are stored as documents inside a larger
        collection, but also contain their own subcollection which holds a
        separate document for each user comment. This appears to be the most
        performant solution.
      </p>

        <img
          src="../images/article/cap5.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/mobile/cap5mob.jpg"
          class="small-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the relatively small scale of the project, the integration of a
        number of distinct components required considerable thought for
        organisation. This was especially true in relation to managing the flow
        of information between parent and child components in React.
      </p>

        When deciding to build the site, I knew I would need some kind CMS which
        allowed me to publish articles to the site, but which would also allow
        me to populate more the more intricate components which arenâ€™t simply
        blocks of text. Ultimately I decided that I wanted complete control over
        this process and decided to build a custom CMS structured around the
        components in the app. You can read a little about what went into that
        here.
