      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        English Deck is as a minimum viable product for an e-learning platform
        built with React. The goal was to create highly interactive articles for
        English learners which included flashcards, a quiz, and a section for
        writing practice and reading submissions from other learners. The
        information from each of these elements is stored and retrieved from
        Firebase on the back-end.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cap1.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/mobile/cap2mob.jpg"
          class="small-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        The entire app is designed to be a reusable article template, and the
        app itself also contains reusable components. It therefore made sense to
        create the app with React. Using Firebase was also an obvious choice as
        it allows for rapid development both in terms of storage and
        authentication.
      </p>

        <img
          src="../images/article/cap4.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot wide-cap"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img

        />
      </div>
      <h3>Challenges and Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        Organising the information flow between components was tricky and I
        considered whether I would need to use the Context API in order to avoid
        prop drilling. Ultimately, this wasn’t necessary and the project mainly
        relies on the use of props and the useState and useEffect hooks.
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        I would like to come back to the project and use it as an opportunity to
        learn more about the Firestore data model and NoSQL databases. I think
        this would also be a good opportunity to incorporate React Router and
        scale the app into a site which can easily be updated with more
        interactive articles which follow the same template.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cap5.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
        <img
          src="../images/article/mobile/cap5mob.jpg"
          class="small-cap screenshot"
          alt="project-screenshot-mobile"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the relatively small scale of the project, the integration of a
        number of distinct components required considerable thought for
        organisation. This was especially true in relation to managing the flow
        of information between parent and child components in React.
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        The project was large enough in scale to allow me to deepen my
        understanding of React Hooks, and I’m looking forward to working on
        something which will allow me to work more with other elements of React,
        such as the Context API and Custom Hooks.
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        Working with React and Firebase was also an excellent chance to practice
        more with asynchronous JavaScript and introduced a new set of challenges
        (and a new set of error codes!), which gave me a deeper understanding of
        asynchronicity, callback functions and promises.
