      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted a content management for the site which would allow me to
        update it with a single click, while providing all the data that was
        needed for the interactive elements on the site, such as the flashcards
        and quizzes. My solution was to build a CMS with sections corresponding
        to individual components in the React app. This also allowed me complete
        control over the structure of the database.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box-col">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cmscap1.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot img-in-col"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Build</h3>
      <p>
        I started with a clear idea that I wanted individual components to
        update a single object which was accessible to their common parent so
        that all of the data could be uploaded to the database (or edited) with
        a single click. By keeping the app modular in this way, I hope to easily
        be able to scale the CMS to the needs of the website, which is something
        I plan to continue working on, adding more interactive elements which
        will have their own corresponding sections in the CMS.
      </p>
      <div class="screenshot-box-col">
        <img
          src="../images/article/cmscap2.JPG"
          class="large-cap screenshot wide-cap img-in-col"
          alt="project-screeenshot"
        />
      </div>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The app is relatively simple so there weren’t too many technical
        challenges that I came across during the build. However, I was surprised
        by how much thought had to go into designing the functionality. Some
        questions I had to ask were: Should section edits be saved automatically
        or require manual saves? When does it make sense to add a tab system as
        opposed to displaying all the information on the page in a list? What
        kind of feedback should users get when updating, saving and deleting
        elements?
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        I also had to think about how to organise the database when it came to
        storing user comments. As Firebase is optimised for collections which
        can hold a large number of smaller documents, I decided on a structure
        whereby individual articles are stored as documents inside a larger
        collection, but also contain their own subcollection which holds a
        separate document for each user comment. This appears to be the most
        performant solution.
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        Since finishing the functionality of the app and using it to update my
        site, I realise that I got some of the answers to those questions wrong.
        Users are required to manually save edits to the vocabulary section,
        which feels clunky in practice. It also doesn’t feel like there is
        enough feedback to indicate successful saves on edit. Although these are
        not huge changes to make, I do wish I had spent a little more time
        testing out the user experience while making that section, and it’s
        certainly something I will start doing more of when working on future
        builds.
