      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        With more and more learning taking place online, I wanted to create a
        way for language learners to have conversations with teachers online
        through a messenger which was specifically designed to enable
        corrections and learning opportunities which could be seamlessly
        integrated into the conversation.

      </div>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        I chose to use Tailwind primarily with the aim of spending less time on
        the design process and responsiveness in order to prioritise time spent
        on the functionality of the app. React was used because of the number of
        reusable components there would be in the app, from dynamically created
        tab components, to the messages themselves. Firebase was used on the
        back-end as the project required authentication, a database, as well as
        storage for audio files. Firebase allowed for easy integration of all
        these features, as well as hosting.

        />

        />
      </div>
      <h3>Challenges and Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges I had with this project was working with
        audio. One such challenge was in regard to appending audio to messages
        which had already been created and rendered in the messenger. Ultimately
        the solution was simply to store the audio files in folders which served
        as references to individual messages. I did however encounter some
        stumbling blocks related to audio blobs and audio URLs which took longer
        than they should have to resolve. Sometimes it is easy to get caught up
        in the enthusiasm to just get things to work, where in fact it is often
        a better use of time to take a step back and learn a little more about
        the technology you are using before getting started with it.
      </p>
      <p id="p-below-p">
        I consider the application very much a work in progress and I intend to
        keep coming back to it to make improvements and add new features.
        Firstly, my solution to dynamically creating tabbed components does not
        use dynamic routing, which Iâ€™m now quite sure would be a better way of
        implementing such a feature. In terms of UX, clicking elsewhere in the
        messenger should deselect previously selected messages, and student
        users should receive clear feedback that words they have selected have
        been highlighted for the teacher. There are also a number of other
        features which I feel would benefit the application, but for now will be
        focussing on polishing it up and getting some feedback from potential
        users.

      <h3 id="h3-below-p">Lessons Learned</h3>
      <p>
        This project has further highlighted to me the importance of
        organisation and planning ahead where possible. This may be especially
        true of React apps where consideration must be given to the flow of
        information between components. No doubt being able to adapt to the
        evolution of a project is an important skill, but looking back on the
        project, I feel as though I could have saved quite a lot of time if I
        had started with a clearer vision of exactly how the project should have
        been organised.
